# MathGPT-OpenSource

**MathGPT-OpenSource is an open-source platform where AI enthusiasts and researchers can develop and test AI models that solve mathematical problems. The goal is to create highly efficient, accurate, and fast models to tackle various mathematical challenges.

## 🚀 Project Overview

MathGPT is designed to evaluate AI models for solving mathematical problems. Users can submit their models, and our platform will evaluate their performance based on standardized math problem datasets. This collaborative project aims to continuously improve model performance through contributions from the open-source community.

## 🎯 How to Participate

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MathGPT-OpenSouce.git

## Step 2: Build Your Model

- Develop your AI model using any machine learning or deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn).
- Ensure your model adheres to the input/output format outlined in the [Model Submission Guide](#-model-submission-guide).
- Test your model locally with our sample dataset (included in the repo).

## Step 3: Submit Your Model

- Commit your model code to your forked repository.
- Create a pull request (PR) to submit your model for testing.
- Make sure to include a `README.md` in your submission describing your approach, any unique features of your model, and how to run it.


## 🔍 Model Submission Guide

Your model should follow these guidelines to ensure compatibility with the platform:

- **Input**: JSON format representing the mathematical problem.
- **Output**: JSON format with the solution.

Example input and output:

``` json
{
  "problem": "solve x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0",
  "output": "x = 1, x = -5"
}
```
For more detailed input and output formats, refer to the [Submission Details](./submission_details.md).

## 💡 Evaluation Criteria

Your model will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The correctness of the solution provided by the model.
- **Speed**: The time taken to solve the problem.
- **Efficiency**: The amount of computational resources (CPU, memory) used by the model.


## 💻 Local Setup for Testing

To test your model locally before submission:

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
2. Run the sample test suite to validate your model:

   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```
